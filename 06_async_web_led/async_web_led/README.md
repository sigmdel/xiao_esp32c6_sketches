# Additional Libraries 

The `async_web_led` sketch is dependent on two libraries from ESP32Async

  1. [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/ESP32Async/AsyncTCP) version 3.4.10 by ESP32Async
  2. [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer) version 3.9.6 by ESP32Async

Minimalist copies of the libraries are included in the [../../libraries](../../libraries/README.md) directory. 
**Please do not redistribute these files and always return to the original source when using the libraries in other projects.**
