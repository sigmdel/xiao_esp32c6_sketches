# 14_zigbee-on-off-switch

The `Zigbee_On_Off_Switch` directory contains basically a clone of the example sketch from the `esp32` Arduino core version 3.1.1 with slight adjustments to support the XIAO ESP32C6 board.

A new Zigbee_On_Off_Switch/[Readme](Zigbee_On_Off_Switch/README.md) file contains details about the changes. It also shows that the Zigbee_On_Off_Light end device can connect to the Zigbee_On_Off_Switch coordinator so that the latter's boot button controls the LED on the Zingbee_On_Off_Light device.
