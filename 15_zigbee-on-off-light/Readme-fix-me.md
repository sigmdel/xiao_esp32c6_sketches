# 09-zigbee-bulb

The `Zigbee_Light_Bulb` directory contains basically a clone of the example sketch from the `esp32` version 3.0.2 package which is found here in a Linux system:
`~/.arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/3.0.2/libraries/ESP32/examples/Zigbee/Zigbee_Light_Bulb`

However it was necessary to make slight adjustments to the code when using that sketch in conjunction with the `Zigbee_Light_Switch` with two ESP32-C6 boards.

## Modifications to the Source

### LED vs RGB_LED

Some modification of the source code was necessary to support the XIAO ESP32-C6 and other boards that have an onboard LED but not an RGB LED. Changes are easily identified because of the use of ```#if defined(RGB_BUILTIN)```.

```cpp
#if defined(RGB_BUILTIN)
  #define LED_PIN RGB_BUILTIN
#elif defined(LED_BUILTIN)
  #define LED_PIN LED_BUILTIN
  #define LED_ON LOW           // LOW = I/O pin must be grounded to turn on LED
#else
  #error "NO LED defined"
#endif
```

### 
Note that on the XIAO the LED is turned on by writing LOW to its I/O pin. Set `#define LED_ON HIGH` for boards where setting the I/O pin high turns the LED on.


### Minimum Link Quality Indicator

If Zigbee bulb does not connect to the Zigbee switch, with the following debug output

```
esp_zb_app_signal_handler(): Network steering was not successful (status: ESP_FAIL)
```

then it may be necessary to adjust the Link Quality Indicator threshold as suggested by [xiequnan](https://github.com/espressif/esp-zigbee-sdk/issues/363#issuecomment-2160086939). He proposed a value of 32, but matthiasbuettner159 in the next message used a value of 0. 

By default, the LQI threshold is not modified, uncomment the `LQI_THRESHOLD` macro and modify its value as desired. 

```
//#define LQI_THRESHOLD 32
```

If `LQI_THRESHOLD` is defined, the LQI threshold will be set in the `esp_zb_task` function.  

```cpp
static void esp_zb_task(void *pvParameters) {
  esp_zb_cfg_t zb_nwk_cfg = ESP_ZB_ZED_CONFIG();
  esp_zb_init(&zb_nwk_cfg);
  esp_zb_on_off_light_cfg_t light_cfg = ESP_ZB_DEFAULT_ON_OFF_LIGHT_CONFIG();
  esp_zb_ep_list_t *esp_zb_on_off_light_ep = esp_zb_on_off_light_ep_create(HA_ESP_LIGHT_ENDPOINT, &light_cfg);
  esp_zb_device_register(esp_zb_on_off_light_ep);
  esp_zb_core_action_handler_register(zb_action_handler);
  esp_zb_set_primary_network_channel_set(ESP_ZB_PRIMARY_CHANNEL_MASK);
  #if defined(LQI_THRESHOLD)
  esp_zb_secur_network_min_join_lqi_set(LQI_THRESHOLD);
  #endif
  
  //Erase NVRAM before creating connection to new Coordinator
  esp_zb_nvram_erase_at_start(true);  //Comment out this line to erase NVRAM data if you are conneting to new Coordinator

  ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_zb_start(false));
  esp_zb_main_loop_iteration();
}
```

## Compiling 

The Troubleshooting guide in the sketch [README.md](Zigbee_Light_Bulb/README.md) file suggests erasing the flash before uploading the firmware: 

> You can do the following:
>  - In the Arduino IDE go to the Tools menu and set Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload to Enabled
>  - In the sketch uncomment function esp_zb_nvram_erase_at_start(true); located in esp_zb_task function.

Presumably, if `esp_zb_nvram_erase_at_start(true);` is not a comment (it is NOT in the example sketch), the non-volatile storage will be erased when the task starts and there would not be any need to erase all flash before uploading the sketch. On the other hand, commenting out `esp_zb_nvram_erase_at_start(true);` could make pairing faster.

Do not forget to set the Arduino configuration as instructed before compiling. Here are the settings used with a XIAO ESP32C6

With these settings, and with a LQI_THRESHOLD of 32, the XIAO ESP32-C6 did pair with another XIAO ESP32-C6 running th Zigbee_Light_Switch sketch.
