# 15_zigbee-on-off-light

The `Zigbee_On_Off_Light` directory contains basically a clone of the example sketch from the `esp32` Arduino core version 3.1.1 with slight adjustments to support the XIAO ESP32C6 board.

A new Zigbee_On_Off_Light/[Readme](Zigbee_On_Off_Light/README.md) file contains details about the changes and also shows that the Zigbee_On_Off_Light end device can connect to a Zigbee2MQTT coordinator. In the near future, [First Look at the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6](https://www.sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c6_intro_en.html) or perhaps a new posting, will expand on that later development.
