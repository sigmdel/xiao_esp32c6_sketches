# XIAO ESP32C6 Sketches
**Arduino source code that accompanies [First Look at the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c6_intro_en.html)**.

## Introduction

The [XIAO ESP32C6](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C6-p-5884.html) is a recent addition to the [Seeed Studio XIAO series](https://www.seeedstudio.com/xiao) of diminutive development boards. It is based on the Espressif ESP32-C6 SoC which is the second Espressif microcontroller based on a RISC-V core.

## PlatformIO Notes

The current Espressif 32 [platform (version 6.9.0 dated Sept 26, 2024)](https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32/releases) in PlatformIO (PIO) is based on version 2.0.17 of the ESP32 Arduino core. Consequently it does not support the XIAO ESP32C6 (see [Add board support for Seeed XIAO ESP32C6](https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32/pull/1380#issuecomment-2205808510)). 

However, a *fork was created due to the lack of ongoing development for the Espressif 32 Arduino Core for PlatformIO*. Using [pioarduino (p)eople (i)nitiated (o)ptimized (arduino)](https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32) and a *homebrew* [board definition file](boards/README.md), it is possible to compile all the projects.

Because of the Arduino sketch naming constraints, the `main.cpp` file of a project is not stored in the default `src` directory. A `src_dir` entry in the `platformio.ini` configuration file provides the name of the directory in which `main.cpp` is found. That will be the name of the Arduino sketch as shown below for the `02_blink_pulse_led` project.

```ini
[platformio]
; Make the Arduino IDE happy (.INO file must be in a directory of the same name)
src_dir = blink_pulse_led
boards_dir = ../boards

[env:seeed_xiao_esp32c6]
platform = https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32/releases/download/51.03.07/platform-espressif32.zip 
board = seeed_xiao_esp32c6         
...
```

PlatformIO will "convert" the `blink_pulse_led.ino` sketch file, but that is of no consequence since it contains only comments.

Note that the *stable* branch of the **pioarduino platform** is used is all projects except for the first `01_pin_names`. In that case, the *develop*ment branch is used to test the merge of the `seeed_xiao_esp32c6.json` board definition file into the repository ([Add Seeed XIAO ESP32C6 board definition #46](https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32/pull/46)).

```ini
[platformio]
; Make the Arduino IDE happy (.INO file must be in a directory of the same name)
src_dir = pin_names

[env:seeed_xiao_esp32c6]
platform = https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32.git#develop
board = seeed_xiao_esp32c6
...
```

## Arduino IDE Notes

The latest version of the Arduino IDE can be obtained for Windows, Linux and macOS in the [Downloads](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) page from Arduino. 

Install the latest Espressif ESP32 Arduino core.

 1. Add https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json in the Additional Boards Manager URLS in the Preferences window in the IDE.
  
 1.  Install platform `esp32` by Espressif version 3.0.2 or newer with the Boards Manager

Select the `XIAO_ESP32C6` board in the `Tools` menu of the IDE when compiling a project.

Arduino sketches must have an `.ino` file name extension and must be contained in a directory that has the same name as the Arduino sketch (excluding the extension). Consequently the `01_pin_names` project contains a directory named `pin_names` that in turn contains the Arduino sketch `pin_names.ino`. That sketch is basically empty as it is a long comment only. This is not a problem because the Arduino IDE will import all source files found in the sketch directory. The actual code is in `main.cpp` which is the default name of a PlatformIO project.

  2. Similar to sketch in [supermini_esp32c3_sketches](https://github.com/sigmdel/supermini_esp32c3_sketches)
  3. Released under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
  4. Create a `secret.h` file with the correct Wi-Fi credentials using the `secrets.h.template` as a model. 
  5. Need to install two libraries. The details are in [libraries/README.md](libraries/README.md).
  6. Added support for some XIAO ESP32C6 features. Released under the Apache License, Version 2.0 .
  7. Requires an external pull up resistor in [most cases](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c6_intro_en.html#deep_sleep).


### About `08_zigbee_switch` and `09_zigbee_bulb`: 

Flash the Zigbee_Light_Switch firmware on one XIAO ESP32C6 and the Zigbee_Light_Bulb firmware on a second XIAO ESP32C6. The boot button on the first board will toggle the yellow LED on/off on the second board. 

The Zigbee_Light_Bulb board will pair with a Zigbee2MQTT coordinator although it is not supported by the latter. 

With the August 6, 2024 correction that enables the RF switch and properly selects an antenna, it is no longer necessary to reduce the link quality threshold in the Zigbee_Light_Bulb sketch. Nevertheless, the LQI_THRESHOLD macro remains in the code.

### Further Details:

See [First Look at the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c6_intro_en.html) for some details about these programs.
